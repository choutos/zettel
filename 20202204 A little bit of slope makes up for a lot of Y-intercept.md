_If you have two lines, the red line and the blue line, and the red line has a lower Y-intercept but a greater slope […] then eventually the red line will cross the blue line. In a mathematical sense, it’s kind of obvious [a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of Y-intercept].

I think this is a pretty good guideline for life. What I mean is that how fast you learn is a lot more important than how much you know to begin with. So in general I say that people emphasize too much on how much they know and not how fast they’re learning._
