Being a data-driven company requires 3 interdependent initiatives
======
keywords: #data #data-driven #bigdata #datascience

Identify, combine, and manage multiples sources of data
------
> You might already have all the data you need. Or you might need to be creative to find other sources for it. Either way, you need to eliminate silos of data while constantly seeking out new sources to inform your decision-making.
Demanding data from different and independent sources leads to much better decisions.

Build advance analytics models for predicting and optimizing outcomes
------
> The most effective approach is to identify a business opportunity and determine how the model can achieve it. In other words, you don't start with data but with a problem.

Transform the organization and culture so that data produces better decisions
------
> Many big data initiatives fail because they aren't in sync with day-to-day processes and decision-making habits.
Data professionals must understand what decisions their business users make, and give users the tools they need to make those decisions.
