1. What background information would someone who is completely unfamiliar with your field need to know to understand the findings in your paper? (Suggested word limit: 150 words)
 - Include something that most readers will be able to relate to in the first sentence. Get gradually more specific in the following sentences.
 - Don't try to explain the background to your entire field; instead consider which details a reader would need to know to understand the new findings, and then explain these facts as clearly and concisely as you can.
 - Make sure to provide simple definitions or explanations for all technical terms and acronyms.

2. What exact research question did you set out to answer and why? (Suggested word limit: 75 words)
 - Provide context by making it clear if this question was asking something completely new, or if you wanted to test or build upon previous findings.
 - Make sure that you explain why it was important to find an answer this question (why should people care whether you can answer this question or not?).

3. What are the most important findings of your paper? (Suggested word limit: 100 words)
 - Focus on findings highlighted in the title or abstract of your paper, and explain them clearly and completely.
    If possible, describe your methodology with a sentence or two.
    Always mention which species, type of organism or cells you have studied (for example, mutant mice, fruit flies, human kidney cells, or cancer cells).

4. Who might eventually benefit from the findings of your study, and what would need to be done before we could achieve these benefits? (Suggested word limit: 75 words)
 - Think beyond your immediate field of research, and explain how your findings could lead to a benefit for wider society (patients, the environment, and so on).
 - Avoid hype or exaggeration. For example, if your findings are about a fundamental process in living cells that could be relevant to understanding cancer, you should mention the link but be careful not to imply that the findings will imminently lead to new treatments.
