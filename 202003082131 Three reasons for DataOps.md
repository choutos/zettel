Data isn't a static thing
------
According to Gartner, big data can be described by the "Three V's [1]: volume, velocity and variety. It's also changing constantly: Monday, machine learning might be a priority; Tuesday, need to focus on predictive analytics; Friday, processing transactions.
Infrastructure needs to support all these different workloads.
With DataOps you can create new models, reprioritize workloads, and extract value from your data by promoting communication and collaboration.  
  
Technology is not enough
------
Data science and the technology that supports it is getting stronger every day. But these tools are only good if they are applied in a consistent and reliable way.  
  
Greater agility is needed
------
The agility needed today is much more than in the 90s, which is when **data-warehousing architecture** and best practices emerged. Organizational agility around data is much, much faster today- so many times faster, in fact, that we need to change the very cadence of the data organization ilself.
