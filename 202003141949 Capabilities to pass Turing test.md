>A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.

The computer would need to posses the following capabilities:
* __natural language processing_ to enable it to communicate successfully in English;
* __knowledge representation__ to store what it knows or hears;
* __automated reasoning__ to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
* __machine learning__ to adapt to new circunstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
