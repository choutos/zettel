 The Structure of an Academic Paper
========================
keyworks: #paper #science #research

Title
------
Simple, clear, short, displaying all the key concepts, straight to the point and
powerful.

Abstract
------
Synthesizes the main points of the paper. It is the most important part of your paper.
It shows what you achieved, it's the showcase of your paper.
When you read it you have to know exactly what the paper is about, what you 
contributed to.
Often after that, you will find some key words that will classify your paper and
help referencing it. You have to think of the right strategy keywords. 

Introduction
------
It must find a balance between saying everything and keeping some mystery about
your research. The most important here is to identify fast and clearly the
research question.

Literature review
------
This part is not about being exhaustive but presenting what is needed to get to
the research question.
You have to show the limits of previous research to justify the necessity of
your own work.

Methodology
------
In this section you basically explain your research design. You justify the way 
you proceeded with your research. Why is it relevant, why does it have to be 
done in this very specific way, etc. In some journals you have to be thorough, 
inD some less so.

__Methodology --> Research Design
              --> Data collect, experiment
              --> Data analysis__

__Valid + reliable + rigorous = scientific__

Results/analysis
------
Here you present your findings. 


Discussion
------
You justify how it contributes to past literature you described before.
Basically, this is where you prove the relevance of your work. You remind the
reader of the research question, summarize the analysis, the results, the
findings, and then explain how you contribute to precious literature.

If these contributions have implications on research, then you should make them
explicit.

Conclusion
------
The form differs a lot, depending on the journal and discipline.

Sometimes is where you show the limits of your work and how you are planning to
address them in future research. Sometimes it's just a short summary of your
research question and contributions.
In any case the conclusion should be short and powerfuli in case it's the only
thing people read.

Others
------
* References, tables, figures, graphs.
* Appendix.
